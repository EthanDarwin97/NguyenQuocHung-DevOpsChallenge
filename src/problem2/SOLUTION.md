Architecture for a Highly Available Trading System
Overview
To build a highly available, scalable, and resilient trading system like Binance, we must focus on certain key components. We will leverage AWS services to achieve the required scalability, availability, and cost-efficiency while keeping the response time under 100ms (p99).
The system must be fault-tolerant and handle high throughput (500 requests per second), while also being cost-effective for the given workload.
The key features for this architecture include:
•	Order Matching Engine: Handles order matching and trade execution.
•	User Authentication: Ensures secure and authenticated access.
•	Market Data Service: Provides real-time price feeds and trading data.
•	Wallet Service: Manages user assets and balances.
•	Trade History & Reporting: Tracks past transactions and trade history.
•	Monitoring and Logging: For real-time diagnostics and performance tracking.

                         
                                          
Key AWS Services and Explanation
1. Amazon API Gateway
•	Role: Manages incoming API requests and acts as a proxy for backend services.
•	Why it’s used: API Gateway is highly scalable and cost-efficient for handling millions of requests per day. It allows us to easily throttle and control traffic, provide security with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), and support rate-limiting for each user.
•	Alternative: AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), but API Gateway provides deeper integration with Lambda and is better suited for serverless architectures.
2. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
•	Role: Distributes incoming traffic to EC2 instances or microservices.
•	Why it’s used: ELB automatically balances the traffic between multiple instances and ensures high availability. We use this to direct traffic to different microservices like the order matching engine, wallet service, etc.
•	Alternative: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for advanced routing or Network Load Balancer (NLB) for extreme throughput.
3. EC2 Auto Scaling Group
•	Role: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demand.
•	Why it’s used: To ensure horizontal scalability, EC2 Auto Scaling groups adjust the number of instances up and down based on traffic load. This helps ensure high availability and maintain performance within the 100ms p99 response time.
•	Alternative: ECS with Fargate or EKS for containerized applications.
4. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
•	Role: Stores and manages user accounts, trade data, balances, and market data.
•	Why it’s used: RDS provides a managed relational database that scales easily. It supports high availability with Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas for scaling.
•	Alternative: DynamoDB (NoSQL), but RDS is more suitable for relational data, and supports complex queries needed for trading and reporting.
5. Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)
•	Role: Caching layer for high-speed access to frequently used data (e.g., market prices, active orders).
•	Why it’s used: Redis offers high-speed data access and can cache responses to avoid frequent hits to the backend database. It helps to ensure low latency (below 100ms) for high-throughput requests.
•	Alternative: Memcached, but Redis is better for complex data structures, such as maintaining active order books.
6. Amazon CloudWatch
•	Role: Monitoring, logging, and alerting for application health, performance, and error tracking.
•	Why it’s used: CloudWatch allows real-time monitoring of the system. Alerts for performance degradation can be set to trigger auto-scaling or even alert teams for manual intervention.
•	Alternative: Datadog, but CloudWatch integrates seamlessly with AWS.
7. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
•	Role: Storing static assets such as logs, backups, and trading reports.
•	Why it’s used: S3 is highly durable and scalable, offering low-cost storage for backups, transaction logs, and reports.
•	Alternative: EBS or Glacier, but S3 is the most cost-effective and scalable for this use case.
8. AWS Lambda (Optional)
•	Role: Handle asynchronous tasks such as trade notifications, email alerts, etc.
•	Why it’s used: Lambda provides serverless compute with event-driven architecture. It scales automatically and reduces the need to maintain dedicated servers for some microservices.
•	Alternative: EC2 for more complex processing but Lambda offers a serverless approach, reducing operational overhead.
High Availability and Scalability
1. High Availability
•	Cross-AZ Deployment: All critical services (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS, ElastiCache, Load Balancers) will be deployed in multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure that failure in one AZ doesn’t impact the system.
•	Multi-Region Setup: For global high availability, we can replicate data and services across regions. However, this is an advanced approach that can be used for extremely high traffic or international platforms.
•	Auto Scaling: EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and other services scale automatically based on traffic to meet demand. Elastic Load Balancer distributes traffic across instances, reducing single points of failure.
2. Scalability
•	Horizontal Scaling: Auto scaling groups for EC2 instances will horizontally scale based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics, ensuring that system performance is consistent as load increases.
•	Microservices Architecture: By using separate microservices for order matching, wallet service, and market data, the system can scale independently. If one service experiences high traffic, it can be scaled without affecting others.
•	Database Scaling: RDS will scale using read replicas to distribute read traffic, while write traffic is directed to the primary node. ElastiCache ensures that frequently accessed data (e.g., market prices) is served fast without hitting the database.
3. Cost Efficiency
•	Pay-As-You-Go: AWS services such as EC2, Lambda, and S3 provide a pay-as-you-go model that minimizes upfront costs. We will leverage Reserved Instances and Savings Plans for predictable workloads.
•	Efficient Use of Services: By using ElastiCache to offload database read operations and Lambda for asynchronous tasks, we optimize resource usage.
•	Spot Instances: EC2 Spot Instances can be leveraged to reduce costs for non-critical workloads, while ensuring the critical services remain on On-Demand or Reserved Instances.
Plans for Scaling
As the product grows beyond the current setup, the following steps can be taken to ensure scalability:
1.	Move to Microservices with Kubernetes (EKS): For advanced scaling, containerizing services using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) will allow dynamic scaling and resource allocation.
2.	Distributed Databases: Scale the database layer horizontally by moving to Amazon Aurora (which supports sharding) or DynamoDB for certain use cases (e.g., user sessions, market data).
3.	Global Distribution: For international scaling, we can deploy across multiple AWS regions and replicate services globally.
4.	Caching Layer Expansion: Introduce more granular caching (e.g., market price data, order book) with AWS Global Accelerator to improve response times.
Conclusion
This architecture leverages AWS services to build a resilient, scalable, and cost-effective trading system. By focusing on horizontal scalability, high availability, and efficient resource usage, we ensure that the system can handle growing traffic while maintaining low latency and high uptime.
